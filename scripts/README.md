# HBlink4 Scripts

## filter_user_csv.py

Filters the DMR user database to only include US and Canada entries, reducing file size and memory usage.

> **Note**: The dashboard now refreshes `user.csv` automatically on a daily schedule via [dashboard/user_db.py](../dashboard/user_db.py), applying configurable country/callsign/ID filters without a restart. This script remains available for manual / one-off filtering when the automated pipeline isn't in use.

### Usage

#### Download latest user database:
```bash
# Download from radioid.net or other DMR database source
wget -O user_full.csv https://example.com/user.csv
```

#### Filter for US/Canada only:
```bash
# Process and save to user.csv
python3 scripts/filter_user_csv.py user_full.csv user.csv

# Or overwrite the original file:
python3 scripts/filter_user_csv.py user.csv
```

#### Output:
```
